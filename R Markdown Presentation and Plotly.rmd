**R Markdown Presentation and Plotly**

**Author** --- Shivangi Mehta

**Date** --- 10/23/2021

**Instruction**

Create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly. Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities. Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a plot created with Plotly. We would love to see you show off your creativity! Review criteria

The rubric contains the following two questions:

1.Does the web page feature a date and is this date less than two months before the date that youâ€™re grading this assignment?
2.Is the web page a presentation and does it feature an interactive plot that appears to have been created with Plotly?

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(plotly)
Product_a <- c(1:100)
x <- Product_a
x
cost_of_product_a <- rnorm(100, mean=0)
y <- cost_of_product_a
data <- data.frame(x,y)
p <- plot_ly(data, x = ~x, y = ~y, type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines')
p
```
